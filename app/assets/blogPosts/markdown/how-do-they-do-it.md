Did you ever have that feeling when you looked at a website?  It happens to me all the time.  Usually it's not too difficult to quickly look through the code and find information about a site.  However, there are tools that can help you at figure out that kind of information WITHOUT digging around too much in the mud.  This post isn't so much about how to use them, since they're pretty friggin straightforward.  But I think just knowing they exist can make life a little easier and more fun, so I thought I'd share them.

####Wappalyzer
This blog post was inspired by my friend who showed me [Wappalyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg?hl=en).  It's a pretty sweet application that lets you see what technologies were used to make a site.  It's not always 100% accurate, but you can find out some really interesting things, and it'll tell you when it doesn't quite recognize what's being used.

###Fontface Ninja
[Fontface Ninja](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontface-ninja/eljapbgkmlngdpckoiiibecpemleclhh?hl=en-US) lets you quickly figure out what fonts someone is using!  It's also got a mask feature so you can focus on just the text and how it looks by itself.

###ColorPick Eyedropper
[ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en-US) is pretty much the same thing, but for colors.  What I like about this one in comparison to others, is that it really lets you zoom in on each pixel and makes it huge, so it's easy to see the color you were looking for.

Boom shackalacka!  Pretty cool stuff, right?  There are alternative programs for Firefox, too, and [Wappalyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/) is avaiable for the platform.  So hop on it and start learning about how them other sites go so pretty!
